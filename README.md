Yes... this is small (or at least it should be)! I just can't handle a lot of shortcuts and
functionalities, so I compiled the most common and easy to use plugins.

Currently, I'm working with:

* Javascript (*1)
* Markdown
* Python (*2)

Enjoy! :)

(*1) `make install` will create a `.tern-project` inside your `$HOME`. If you
want a customized configuration per project, just create a Tern file inside the
project root folder. Oh... make sure to install `tern` globally.

(*2) You should install `jedi` inside every `virtualenv` you are working on. At least for now
I'm not picking a "global" binary for jedi.

## Getting started

[Vim 8](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/doc/version8.txt) FTW \o/.

### Installing vim-plug

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) you can easily install
add-ons to your `vim`:

    curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

See more details in [vim-plug repository](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

### Installing .vimrc

It's possible to install vimfiles using `Makefile`. It'll make
a symbolic link of the configuration file to `~/` path.

 Â   $ make install

### Installing plugins

Open `vim` and run `:PlugInstall`.

[Check out the plugin list](https://github.com/kplaube/vimfiles/blob/master/.vimrc#L8).

### Fonts

In order to use `vim-airline` and `nerdtree` without any kind of problem regarding fonts,
it's recommended to install and use the
[Droid Sans Mono for Powerline.otf](https://github.com/kplaube/vimfiles/blob/master/fonts/Droid%20Sans%20Mono%20for%20Powerline.otf)
font file.
